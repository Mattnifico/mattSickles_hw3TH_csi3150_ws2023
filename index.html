                <h1>Moonball: A Popular Earth Pastime with a Lunar Twist</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <p>Moonball is a exhilirating game based off of multiple activities popular on earth. A mix of basketball
                    and football with a gravity-defying twist, Moonball involves two teams vying for control of a ball and 
                    making it collide with the moon's surface.</p>
                <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
                <p>Moonball starts with two teams of starships taking off from the moon's surface to battle for control of
                    a ball suspended in the air. When one team touches the ball, it turns to that team's color (say if a red
                    team touches the ball, the ball would turn red). Once the ball has turned to a team's color, that team's
                    goal is to get the ball to hit the moon's surface for a point. However, the opposing team can also hit
                    the ball at any point to change it to their color, giving them a point. This means that the game gets
                    increasingly harrowing as the ball gets closer and closer to the moon.</p>
                <h3>Reservations</h3>
                <p>Due to moonball's popularity and limited seating, reservations can only be made on-site or through one
                    of our vacation packages. However, if you are interested in seeing moonball game dates or scheduling
                    your included moonball viewing in your vacation package, please visit our moonball webpage or call the 
                    following number at any time: 1456-8792-1884</p>

        <p>"An incredible experience for the entire family! Lunar Landers had exceptional shuttle service, getting us to the moon in 2 days time! The hospitality was great, the view was amazing, and the activities were exhilirating! I would highly recommend catching a game of Moonball, it's a feeling I've never experienced before!"
